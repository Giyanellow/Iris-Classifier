# Iris Classifier using Multiple Perceptron

## Overview

In this project, I have developed a classifier using the renowned Iris dataset. The project focuses on employing machine learning techniques to create a robust model capable of accurately classifying iris flowers into different species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Introduction

This classifier project not only demonstrates proficiency in handling real-world datasets but also showcases the practical application of machine learning concepts for classification tasks. The implementation is well-documented, and the results are thoroughly analyzed, providing insights into the model's performance and its implications.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset, a classic benchmark in the field of data science, contains samples from three iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Leveraging popular machine learning libraries and algorithms, I implemented a classification model that learns patterns from the dataset and generalizes to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Tools and Libraries

## Installation

To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Giyanellow/Iris-Classifier
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `iris_classifier.ipynb` in Visual Studio Code or your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Execute the cells in sequential order to run the analysis step by step.

## Results
